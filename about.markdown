I\'m 26 years old and currently working at Tobii AB in Kyiv\'s development office. In our OEM team we do bunch of experimental stuff, creating different prototypes and developing some internal projects. And obviously everything is concentrated around Tobii eye-trackers. 

At daily basis we usually work with WPF + C# right now, but we made one project with Python + Django. Occasionally I could read [Learn you a Haskell for a great good][1] in a bus during my trip to work, trying to improve my knowledge in that juicy functional language bit by bit and put more power to control my blog in my hands.

I\'m thinking about start learing JS again once, because so many people recommend this.
